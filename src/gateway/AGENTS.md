# Gateway Hot Paths

Gateway server tests and startup paths should not materialize bundled plugin
runtime when they only need plugin-owned static descriptors.

## Guardrails

- For plugin-owned Gateway behavior such as auth-bypass paths, prefer a
  lightweight public artifact resolver before falling back to the full channel
  plugin.
- Keep the full plugin contract and the lightweight artifact backed by the same
  plugin-owned helper so behavior does not diverge.
- Do not load broad bundled channel registries from Gateway HTTP/server code
  just to answer static questions.
- If adding a new plugin-owned Gateway descriptor, add the core resolver,
  plugin artifact, and mirrored full-plugin export in the same change.
- In Gateway server tests, reuse suite-level servers, authenticated contexts,
  and clients when the behavior under test does not require a fresh
  connect/auth handshake. Reset runtime state explicitly instead of restarting
  the whole server per case.
- Keep schedulers, pollers, and background loops disabled in manual-RPC tests
  unless the test is specifically proving automatic scheduling or lifecycle
  behavior.

## Verification

- Benchmark the affected Gateway test file before/after with
  `pnpm test <file>`.
- Run `pnpm build` when changing Gateway lazy-loading or bundled plugin
  artifacts.

## Human-Facing Reports Rule

- Any report, research brief, audit, comparison, decision packet, itinerary, or source-backed deliverable intended for Jack or another human to read must be delivered as polished HTML or PDF. Do not deliver human-facing reports as raw Markdown.
- Markdown is allowed only for agent-internal notes, scratch files, source sidecars, wiki pages, code docs, or when Jack explicitly asks for Markdown.
- Human-facing HTML/PDF reports must include a readable layout, working clickable links, citations/source ledger where sources matter, and clear artifact paths or file delivery in the final response.
- If a research harness or agent workflow produces Markdown first, render it to HTML and/or PDF before presenting it as the human deliverable.
